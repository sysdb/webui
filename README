                        Web User-Interface for SysDB
                       ==============================

  The SysDB web user-interface provides a graphical client application for
  browsing and querying the system database.

What is SysDB?
--------------

  “System DataBase” (SysDB) is a multi-backend system management and inventory
  collection service. It stores system and inventory information about
  hardware and software systems. This information is (continuously) collected
  from various configurable backends (inventory services, monitoring services,
  etc.) and stored in a graph-like hierarchy of generic objects. The store may
  be queried through a generic interface independent of the active backends.
  Object names are canonicalized before they are added to the store to ensure
  a consistent view of your infrastructure.

  The central object type is a host, which generally represents a physical or
  virtual machine or any other type of physical resource. Hosts, in turn, may
  reference a list of services which represent any kind of logical resource
  like a software system. Both, hosts and services, may reference a list of
  attributes which represent further information about the respective host or
  service object. For example, attributes may specify static information like
  a host's architecture or the software version. A host may also reference a
  list of metrics which are references to performance data stored about the
  host. SysDB supports querying the respective time-series from a backend's
  data store.

  SysDB is free and open source software, licensed under the 2-clause BSD
  license. See COPYING for details.

Install the web-interface
-------------------------

  The SysDB webui is written in Go. It can be installed along with all of its
  dependencies as easy as running the following command:

    go get github.com/sysdb/webui/...

  This will download and install the packages and all of their dependencies
  into GOPATH. See ‘go help get’ for more details.

Running the web-interface
-------------------------

  The SysDB webui is a standalone web application. It can run all on its own
  but it can also be put behind a reverse proxy (e.g. using Apache or nginx).
  It is composed of a dynamic application and a set of static files (images
  and style-sheets) which are shipped along with the source distribution. You
  can start the application using the following command, using the --address
  option to point it at a running SysDB daemon:

    ./webui \
        --address=/var/run/sysdbd.sock \
        --listen=:8080 \
        --static-path=$GOPATH/src/github.com/sysdb/webui/static \
        --template-path=$GOPATH/src/github.com/sysdb/webui/templates

  You can then access the interface by pointing your browser at
  http://localhost:8080

Packages
--------

  While the webui is a standalone application, most of its functionality is
  implemented in a reusable library allowing to integrate it into other
  software written in Go.

  * github.com/sysdb/webui/server: The core of the SysDB web server.

  It makes use of the following packages:

  * github.com/sysdb/go/client (and related packages): A SysDB client
    implementation.

Documentation
-------------

  The documentation for all Go packages is included with the source code in a
  way compatible with the godoc tool. As such, it can be viewed and browsed
  online at <https://godoc.org/github.com/sysdb/webui>.

Getting Help
------------

  Various channels for asynchronous and real-time communication with
  developers and users are available. See <https://sysdb.io/contact/> for
  details about the mailing list, IRC channel, and social media.
